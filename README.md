# GraphicsEngine
This is a basic graphics/game engine written in C++ with allegro

## What is this?
I had recently come across a game engine method I really like in java, and probably against better judgement this is my attempt of porting it over to C++. I don't generally use C++ so this was more or less a way to try to understand how classes work together in it. I would describe that it falls most in line with the MVC design approach.

## Features
 * Largely based off of states, which can be changed at any time in order to better organize level segments
 * Uses [Allegro 5](http://liballeg.org/) to draw graphics
 * Probably includes many don'ts of C++
